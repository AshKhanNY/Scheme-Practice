; You should begin working on the induction and logic review problems I posted -- make a point of having worked on these
; before we need that material in class.  You will want to review weak, strong and structural induction - these topics
; covered in almost all Discrete Math I texts.

; You should also take this quiet time at the start of the course to familiarize yourself with Scheme, using DrRacket.
; This wonderful package includes a great deal of documentation -- including the full manual for R5RS Scheme.  I hope
; you notice - and enjoy - the fact that this manual is very short.  It is the sort of thing that might go well with
; your Cheerios in the morning.

; I take it for granted - I hope I may take it for granted! - that students at your level come to lectures having
; studied previous lectures, to the point where either you understand them and have no questions, or you have specific
; questions that can be addressed in class or the office hour.
